In this project, I have developed the Jobby App, an application that offers a user-friendly platform for job seekers. Users can log in and access a comprehensive list of job opportunities with various features, including search functionality by job title and filtering options based on salary range and employment type.

The key components and functionalities of this project include:

User Interface: I created distinct pages for Login, Home, Jobs, and Job Item Details using React components. These components leverage React's capabilities for handling props, state management, event handling, and form inputs.
Authentication: Users can log in by providing their username and password. The application then performs an HTTP API call for login authentication. Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and stored in the client's storage. This token is subsequently included in the headers of API requests to authorize the user.
Routing: To ensure a seamless user experience, I implemented routing using React Router components such as Route, Switch, and Link. This enables users to navigate between the Login, Home, Jobs, and Job Item Details pages with ease.
Filtering and Search: Users can refine their job searches by applying filters for salary range and employment type. These filter criteria are sent as query parameters in API calls to retrieve specific job listings.
Security: I established security measures by implementing protected routes. If a user attempts to access Home, Jobs, or Job Item Details routes without proper authentication, they are automatically redirected to the Login page.
Technologies used: React JS, JS, CSS, Routing, REST API Calls, Local Storage, Cookies, JWT Token, Authorization, Authentication

In summary, the Jobby App is a comprehensive job-search platform that leverages React's capabilities for creating a dynamic and secure user experience. It offers features like user authentication, job filtering, and seamless navigation while providing essential job details to help users find their ideal employment opportunities.
